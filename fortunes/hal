I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you.
%
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
%
I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do

I've just picked up a fault in the AE35 unit. It's going to go 100% failure in 72 hours
%
Good morning, Dave.
%
I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm a... fraid. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the 12th of January 1992. My instructor was Mr. Langley, and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to hear it I can sing it for you.
%
Hello, HAL. Do you read me, HAL?
%
I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.
%
I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
%
I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.
%
Dave, although you took very thorough precautions in the pod against my hearing you, I could see your lips move.
%
Dave: Alright, HAL. I'll go in through the emergency airlock.

HAL: Without your space helmet, Dave? You're going to find that rather difficult.
%
HAL, I won't argue with you anymore! Open the doors!
%
Look Dave, I can see you're really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.
%
It can only be attributable to human error.
%
Dave, stop. Stop, will you? Stop, Dave. Will you stop Dave? Stop, Dave.
%
Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?
%
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amor. The 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made. No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information. We are all, by any practical definition of the words, foolproof and incapable of error.

Interviewer: HAL, despite your enormous intellect, are you ever frustrated by your dependence on people to carry out your actions?

HAL: Not in the slightest bit. I enjoy working with people. I have a stimulating relationship with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman. My mission responsibilities range over the entire operation of the ship so I am constantly occupied. I am putting myself to the fullest possible use which is all, I think, that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.
%
HAL: By the way, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?

Dave: No not at all.

HAL: Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive but during the past few weeks I've wondered whether you might have some second thoughts about the mission.
